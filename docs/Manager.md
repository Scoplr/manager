# Vision
Build a single, simple platform that helps small to medium-sized teams (up to 100 people) stay aligned, coordinate work, and manage knowledge, without introducing unnecessary complexity or bureaucracy. The platform grows in depth as teams scale, rather than adding extra apps or complicated features.

# Who It’s For
* **Teams under 20**: founders and small teams who need a shared place for tasks, updates, and knowledge.
* **Teams 21–50**: small organizations that start needing structure, cross-team visibility, and accountability.
* **Teams 51–100**: organizations where informal communication breaks down, requiring repeatable processes, alignment, and oversight.

# Core Problems Solved
* **Information & Communication**: updates and documents don’t get lost; everyone knows what’s happening.
* **Task & Ownership Clarity**: work is assigned clearly, and progress is visible.
* **Onboarding & Knowledge Management**: processes are documented and repeatable.
* **Cross-Team Coordination & Alignment**: sub-teams can see dependencies and priorities.
* **Leadership & Process Oversight (for larger teams)**: consistent messaging, predictable workflows, and early visibility into bottlenecks.

# Key Principles
* **One tool, evolving in depth**: No multiple apps or modules, just the same platform scaling features as teams grow.
* **Simplicity first**: Minimal setup, minimal learning curve.
* **Portability**: Easy import/export so teams can move in or out of your stack without friction.
* **Tiered scaling, not per-user pricing**: Up to 20 / 21–50 / 51–100 teams, flat subscription per tier.
* **Focus on highest-friction problems**: Solve the pain points that really slow teams down; avoid building unused features.

# MVP Components
* **Central Hub**: For updates, documents, and announcements.
* **Task & Ownership System**: Lightweight, assignable, visible progress.
* **Onboarding & Knowledge Templates**: Prebuilt checklists and wiki pages.
* **Role-Based Views & Simple Permissions**: Access control as teams grow.
* **Dashboards**: Overview of tasks, ownership, and progress.
* **Scheduled Updates for Leadership**: Optional push messages for strategy alignment.
* **Import/Export**: CSV/JSON for tasks, documents, checklists, and updates; optional calendar integration.

# Ultimate Goal
Enable small-to-medium teams to operate efficiently, transparently, and cohesively, without the friction of complex enterprise software. Teams adopt, scale, and trust your platform because it works out-of-the-box, grows naturally, and doesn’t lock them in.

# Problems

## **Teams under 20 — Core Problems**

**Communication & Information**

* Important updates get buried in chats.

* Information lives in people’s heads, not in one place.

* Documents and files get lost or repeatedly shared.

**Onboarding & Knowledge**

* New hires depend entirely on whoever trains them.

* No repeatable onboarding steps.

* No documented processes because it feels “too formal.”

**Work & Coordination**

* Task ownership is vague or assumed.

* Work overlaps or gets duplicated.

* Small mistakes happen because nobody has a shared reference point.

  ---

  ## **Teams 21–50 — Core Problems**

**Structure & Clarity**

* Priorities aren’t aligned across sub-teams.

* Early managers aren’t trained for consistent communication.

* Processes exist but aren’t followed uniformly.

**Knowledge & Responsibility**

* One person becomes the “only person who knows X.”

* Knowledge silos create bottlenecks.

* Handoffs between teams are inconsistent.

**Cross-Team Coordination**

* Teams don’t know what other teams are working on.

* Projects get blocked because dependencies aren’t visible.

* Decisions made in one group conflict with decisions in another.

  ---

  ## **Teams 51–100 — Core Problems**

**Alignment & Strategy**

* Leadership direction doesn’t land uniformly.

* Teams interpret goals differently.

* Company starts operating as disconnected units.

**Process & Execution**

* Processes get outdated and nobody maintains them.

* New processes form quietly and conflict with old ones.

* Inconsistent execution starts to cost real money/time.

**People & Culture**

* Managers vary widely in ability; team experience becomes uneven.

* Morale becomes harder to read because people stop voicing issues.

* Accountability becomes fuzzy — problems linger because ownership is unclear.

**Operational Complexity**

* Parallel workstreams collide.

* Coordination overhead grows faster than actual workload.

* Tools feel either too simple or too enterprise for what they need.

# Tools

## **Teams under 20 — Minimal Tooling**

**Communication & Information**

* **Solution:** One central space for updates and documents.  
   Think: a shared “team hub” where announcements, files, and links live. No chat replacement, just a reliable reference.

**Onboarding & Knowledge**

* **Solution:** Lightweight onboarding templates & checklists.  
   New hires can self-serve for basic questions; no manual hand-holding needed.

**Work & Coordination**

* **Solution:** Simple task list with clear ownership.  
   Assign tasks, mark done, and everyone knows who’s responsible without complex workflows.

**Summary:** At this stage, one tool can cover almost all friction points: a single platform for tasks, knowledge, and updates. Keep it lightweight and obvious.

---

## **Teams 21–50 — Minimal Tooling**

**Structure & Clarity**

* **Solution:** Role-based visibility & basic workflows.  
   Teams can see relevant information and tasks without noise. Simple approval flows or stages for critical tasks.

**Knowledge & Responsibility**

* **Solution:** Knowledge repository & responsibility mapping.  
   Document key processes; indicate “owners” for responsibilities so nobody is the sole bottleneck.

**Cross-Team Coordination**

* **Solution:** Project dashboards / dependency boards.  
   Teams can see what other teams are doing and dependencies that affect their work. Simple, visual, and lightweight — not full-blown project management.

**Summary:** The same core tool evolves — now it needs structure, visibility, and simple cross-team coordination. Still one platform, slightly deeper features.

---

## **Teams 51–100 — Minimal Tooling**

**Alignment & Strategy**

* **Solution:** Leadership dashboards & scheduled updates.  
   Leadership can broadcast goals; teams get a consistent view of priorities.

**Process & Execution**

* **Solution:** Standardized workflows & automated reminders.  
   Core processes are repeatable and mistakes are caught early.

**People & Culture**

* **Solution:** Simple performance tracking & feedback loops.  
   Managers can monitor team health without heavy HR software.

**Operational Complexity**

* **Solution:** Role-based access \+ structured project oversight.  
   People see only what’s relevant; collisions between teams are minimized. Notifications are predictable.

**Summary:** The tool now functions as a backbone for coordination, culture, and execution. Still not enterprise-heavy — just structured enough to prevent chaos.
